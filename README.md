*The heat from your computer is not wasted if you need to heat your home.*   - Satoshi Nakamoto

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT. TBW = To Be Written**

This repo documents wild adventures deploying applications and services to a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) cluster at home. It is intended both to help the less-experienced and learn from the more-experienced users. Please open an issue if you disagree with design decisions, find any technical errors, have any questions or simply want to discuss something.

English is not my main language, sorry in advance for any typos or grammar errors (PRs are very welcome).
